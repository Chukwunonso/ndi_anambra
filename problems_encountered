Couldn't connect with ansible
Solution:
ansible all -m ping -become-user=root -u root -vvvv

If problem persists
logon with regular ssh root@ndianambraaberdeen.org

If this works
Then run the run ansible all -m ping ... again

Couldn't run github deploy from laptop.
Had to ssh into remote machine.
Move the ssh deploy key from the project to the main account
Run the following commands
cp /home/naa_web/.ssh/id_rsa /root/.ssh/id_rsa
&
cp /home/naa_web/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

So that github can see them

Ran into problem with gpg
deleted signing from .gitconfig
to open run git config --global --edit


Remember local run are like so python manage.py runserver --settings=ndi_anambra.settings.dev

To activate local virtualenv run source venv/bin/activate
