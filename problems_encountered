Couldn't connect with ansible
Solution:
ansible all -m ping -become-user=root -u root -vvvv

If problem persists
logon with regular ssh root@ndianambraaberdeen.org

If this works
Then run the run ansible all -m ping ... again

Couldn't run github deploy from laptop.
Had to ssh into remote machine.
Move the ssh deploy key from the project to the main account
Run the following commands
cp /home/naa_web/.ssh/id_rsa /root/.ssh/id_rsa
&
cp /home/naa_web/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

So that github can see them

Ran into problem with gpg
deleted signing from .gitconfig
to open run git config --global --edit


Remember local run are like so python manage.py runserver --settings=ndi_anambra.settings.dev

Created a new standard user:
On linux use sudo adduser nonso
On mac use System Preferences to add a standard user
Then run `sudo -u postgres psql`

Couldn't find the site: with root@ndianambraaberdeen.org nor on naa_web@...
See: /Users/nonso/ndi_anambra/ndi_anambra/ansible/group_vars/all


After running provision.yml site went off line! 23.02.2018

So I had changed the postgres password because I was prompted in the play. To play I had uncommented
the ansible task to create database fearing the worst.

So to discover this I ran `supervisorctrl tail ndi_anambra` as ssh root
When I changed the .env password contained in the remote everything worked. Including the changes.
